# Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming for State-based Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring 
This repository provides the implementation of the NILM algorithm described in the paper [Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming for State-based Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09158).

The source code is written in Python and the optimization model is implemented in AMPL.
